# Text-Matching
•	Used 2-D convolutional neural network to construct first model
•	Created new features like “longest common sequence”, Dice coefficient, N-gram Jaccard Coefficient, Levenshtein Distance and TF-IDF, etc. 
•	Combined created features and the result of 2-D CNN model to train new machine learning models.
•	Improved log loss from 1.01 to 0.28
